# hbase-csv-backup
Backup single HBase table as a CSV format in local filesystem. We need to pre-define the list of columns we needed from a particular column family. This code uses necessary jars to connect HBase table along with OpenCSV jar to write CSV records. Need to define column type mapping in yaml.
